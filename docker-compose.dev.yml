## This docker-compose.dev.yml file makes a development environmetn
## out of the last docker image (:latest). It creates:
##  - a baked image containing already the /app files (:latest)
## - overwrites the /app files of the baked image by mounting the /app structure of the 
##   working environment on the hard disk
## Now it is ready to become a development environment. For instance, if you make changes 
## to popup.html on the
## hard disk, it will be reflected in the app live
##
## how to run (in order to create container and make it live):
## HOST_IP=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0) docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
